  Despite early emphasis on decentralized organization and individual
  contributions, information commons such as online encyclopedias and
  open-source projects increasingly rely on users working in groups to
  collectively generate content as a shared resource. However, current insights
  into institutions as a driver of group performance are limited. First, the
  effect of institutions is often assessed in the aggregate rather than
  delineated by type. This ignores the fact that different rules govern
  different aspects of group behavior, leading to potential discrepancies in
  their relative effect on group outcomes. Second, groups vary not only in the
  individual rules they adopt but also in global attributes. Some groups exhibit
  greater institutional instability than others. Groups also differ in how
  diverse and how balanced the rules are.


  Guided by the IAD approach, we develop and test several propositions linking rules to outcomes in an information commons. As the largest online encyclopedia in China, Baidu Baike operates as an open platform and relies on individual contributors to build and update encyclopedic entries. Based on a new dataset tracking changes in the rules and performance of 40 self-organized user groups over an eight-year period, our analysis shows that the effects on group performance are typologically imbalanced, in that significant variation in group performance is attributed to only some rule types. As for the global attributes, having a larger and more diverse set of rules generally corresponds with better group performance, while institutional instability does not seem to exert any discernible impact.
