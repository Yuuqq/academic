Welcome to my personal website! This site is built using the Hugo Academic Resum√© Template.

I designed this website to showcase my research, publications, talks, and projects as a PhD candidate in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong. It provides an overview of my academic background, ongoing work, and future research agenda.
