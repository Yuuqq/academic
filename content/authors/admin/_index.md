I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at the University of Hong Kong. My substantive research focuses on issues of digital governance, information commons, and policy information. My methodological research focuses on developing computational methods for institutional analysis from digital platforms and policy documents. My doctoral work aims to develop novel theoretical and methodological frameworks to examine institutional design and its impacts in cyberspace. By investigating the architecture and dynamics of self-governing collaborative groups, I endeavor to gain insights into emerging approaches of information governance and sharing in the Internet age. 

I currently lead a project investigating models of user collaboration in information commons under the supervision of Prof. Kwan Nok Chan. I also participate in a study examining practices of content moderation on Chinese online platforms, also with Prof. Chan. These research endeavors have been supported in part from the Hong Kong's UGC.

These research projects employ a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, informed by theoretical concepts and analytical frameworks from public policy, information science. They seek to provide policy-relevant knowledge for stakeholders interested in fostering an open yet orderly cyberspace. My work aims for a balanced perspective that addresses both the promises and perils of greater connectivity and participation in the digital age.
