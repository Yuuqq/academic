Balancing the decentralized user participation and centralized control of information to promote the prosperity of the online community is a fundamental problem for platform governance under digital authoritarianism. On the one hand, online platforms heavily rely on Peer production (also known as mass collaboration) to enrich the content. To keep active and sustainable, the community needs to give users a relatively loose and free creation environment and timely incentives (e.g., updating the content on the webpage quickly). On the other hand, sensitive content must be censored under an authoritarian regime, which requires centralized control. With the exponential data growth, the government and their hired swords can hardly monitor all content promptly. Therefore, new strategies have been adopted to control the information with new actors under the authoritarian regime. For example, online platforms are required to participate in mass surveillance and directly or indirectly contribute to censorship (Gallagher and Miller, 2021; Hassid, 2020) through the participation and collaborations of different actors. However, the extant literature rarely focuses on these new trends. Here, the case of Baidu Baike (a Chinese online encyclopedia) offers insights into how the authoritarian regime relies on variously restricted communities and their actors (platform employees, co-opted members, all members, etc.) to tailor sensitive content and how actors in the different restricted communities manipulate the content.
