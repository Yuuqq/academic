abstract: How do individuals self-organize information provision in a community
  without centralized leadership? Protesters involved in the 2019
  anti-extradition movement made the unusual decision to organize themselves in
  a “leaderless” structure, thus disabling many low-cost strategies that large
  groups use to apportion limited collective attention across competing
  priorities. Drawing on data from an online forum popular among movement
  participants, we empirically examine propositions that (1) users are sensitive
  to group-level consumption of information and seek to influence it and (2)
  their individual efforts contribute to global efficiency in information
  consumption.
