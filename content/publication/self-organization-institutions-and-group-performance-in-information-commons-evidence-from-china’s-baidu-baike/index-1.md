abstract: Balancing the decentralized user participation and centralized control
  of information to promote the prosperity of the online community is a
  fundamental problem for platform governance under digital authoritarianism. On
  the one hand, online platforms heavily rely on Peer production (also known as
  mass collaboration) to enrich the content. To keep active and sustainable, the
  community needs to give users a relatively loose and free creation environment
  and timely incentives (e.g., updating the content on the webpage quickly). On
  the other hand, sensitive content must be censored under an authoritarian
  regime, which requires centralized control. With the exponential data growth,
  the government and their hired swords can hardly monitor all content promptly.
  Therefore, new strategies have been adopted to control the information with
  new actors under the authoritarian regime. For example, online platforms are
  required to participate in mass surveillance and directly or indirectly
  contribute to censorship (Gallagher and Miller, 2021; Hassid, 2020) through
  the participation and collaborations of different actors. However, the extant
  literature rarely focuses on these new trends. Here, the case of Baidu Baike
  (a Chinese online encyclopedia) offers insights into how the authoritarian
  regime relies on variously restricted communities and their actors (platform
  employees, co-opted members, all members, etc.) to tailor sensitive content
  and how actors in the different restricted communities manipulate the content.
